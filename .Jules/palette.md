## 2026-02-18 - [Missing ARIA Labels on Icon-Only Buttons]
**Learning:** The project uses `LinkButton` component for social media links which are rendered as icon-only buttons. While `title` attributes were present, `aria-label` attributes were missing, making the buttons inaccessible to screen reader users who rely on the accessible name computation. The `LinkButton` component already supports an `ariaLabel` prop, but it was not being utilized in `Socials.astro`.
**Action:** Always verify that icon-only buttons have an explicit `aria-label` or visually hidden text. When using the `LinkButton` component, ensure the `ariaLabel` prop is passed, especially when the content is only an SVG or icon.
